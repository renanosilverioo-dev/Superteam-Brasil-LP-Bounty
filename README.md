## 🎨 Design Approach

Dark-mode Web3 interface designed to balance a **strong Brazilian identity** with **strict alignment to Superteam’s global brand standards**.

The visual system follows established Superteam references (UAE, France, Germany, Vietnam), ensuring consistency across regions, while introducing localized Brazilian signals in a **modern, non-cliché** way.

The goal is clarity, credibility and scalability — presenting Superteam Brazil as a serious, high-quality ecosystem for builders, founders and creators.

## 🎯 Color Strategy

- **Green (`#10B981`)** – Primary brand color, used for CTAs, highlights and key actions  
- **Yellow (`#F59E0B`)** – Brazilian cultural emphasis, used selectively for contrast and emphasis  
- **Blue (`#3B82F6`)** – Web3/global accent for hierarchy and balance  
- **Purple (`#8B5CF6`)** – Superteam Global references and subtle gradient accents  

Colors are intentionally controlled to maintain a premium Web3 feel while reinforcing Brazilian identity.
